> **An open-source implementation of Andrej Karpathy's LLM Wiki idea: an AI that builds and maintains a wiki from your sources.** Not RAG-in-a-vector-DB. A real markdown wiki on your disk, that an LLM gardens for you between conversations.

```bash
npx mindbase-app
```

One command: starts the local server, opens the web app, and walks you through picking a **free local model** that fits your RAM. No API key, nothing leaves your machine. (Node 20+)

</p>

MindBase implements Andrej Karpathy's [LLM-Wiki pattern](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1911080091498963196): you feed it sources (papers, articles, thoughts); the LLM reads, cross-references, flags contradictions, and writes structured wiki pages. Later, when you ask a question, the wiki already has the synthesized answer — no vector-search re-derivation at query time.

**Status:** Early access, actively developed. What's new: [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) · [Releases](https://github.com/frankchu91/mindbase-llm-wiki/releases)

## Why MindBase

You read a lot. Papers, articles, tweets, docs. You want to remember them, connect them, form opinions from them. Today you have two bad options:

- **Notion / Obsidian / Roam:** Passive containers. You do all the organizing. AI features are bolted-on generation, not maintenance.
- **NotebookLM / Perplexity Pages / ChatGPT search:** RAG-based. Nothing accumulates. Every question re-derives the answer from raw sources.

**MindBase is the third option:** the LLM actively maintains a persistent, structured wiki as you feed it sources. Knowledge compounds. Your `context.md` gets sharper every time you contribute. The AI *remembers you across sessions* because your beliefs are written down in markdown files — not stored in a chat history that gets summarized away.

Think of it as **a personal Wikipedia that an AI intern writes for you**, kept up to date, cross-referenced, and honest about what it doesn't know.

## How it works (30 seconds)

Three physical layers on disk (Karpathy's model):

<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/assets/hero-dark.svg">
    <img alt="MindBase: you feed sources, the LLM gardens them into a wiki that compounds — plain markdown on your disk" src="docs/assets/hero-light.svg" width="920">
  </picture>
</p>

| Layer | Who owns it | What lives there |
|---|---|---|
| `sources/` | **You** — append-only, the AI never rewrites it | Quick captures, full notes, PDFs, URLs |
| `context.md` + `sources/research/` | **The AI** — every change human-approved | The maintained wiki: synthesis, concept pages, `[[wikilinks]]` |
| `state/` · `logs/` · `artifacts/` | Derived — always rebuildable | Search index, snapshots, lint findings, op history |

Three operations run the loop: **ingest** (AI reads a source, discusses takeaways, you approve the wiki updates), **build** (regenerate `context.md` from everything unbuilt), **lint** (the AI audits its own wiki for contradictions, stale claims, and orphans).

## What makes it different

- **The AI asks before writing.** Every ingest shows takeaways + a checkbox plan; only what you approve gets written. No black-box edits to your knowledge.
- **You can watch the wiki absorb your notes.** Every note carries a status chip — ✨ *Add to wiki* until digested, ✓ *In wiki* after.
- **It audits its own knowledge.** One command re-reads the whole wiki and reports contradictions with the exact conflicting sentences quoted. Notion and NotebookLM structurally cannot do this.
- **Free and local by default.** Hardware-detect wizard installs the best Ollama model for your RAM. Cloud keys optional.
- **Plain markdown on disk.** Grep it, git it, open it in Obsidian, leave anytime.

## Install

**Browser (fastest):** `npx mindbase-app` — shown above. Everything runs locally at `localhost:4321`.

> **Lokyy Brain v2 — ingesting from `localhost` or your LAN.** The server and MCP server built from this repository refuse to fetch URLs that point at `localhost`, private LAN addresses, or other internal targets (SSRF protection); such URLs fail with `URL not allowed or unreachable`. For a local single-user setup that ingests from those addresses, start the server with `MINDBASE_ALLOW_PRIVATE_FETCH=1`, for example `MINDBASE_ALLOW_PRIVATE_FETCH=1 pnpm -F @mindbase/server dev`. Never set it on a shared or self-hosted deployment. Details: [docs/self-hosting-mcp-http.md](docs/self-hosting-mcp-http.md#outbound-url-fetches-ssrf-protection).

**Claude Code (flagship):** the full Karpathy 8-step ingest with sub-agents, slash commands, and per-agent tool boundaries:

```
/plugin marketplace add frankchu91/mindbase-llm-wiki
/plugin install mb@mindbase
```

Restart when prompted, then type `/` — you should see `/mb:contribute`, `/mb:build`, `/mb:ask`, `/mb:lint` and 8 more. You get 5 sub-agents with strict tool allowlists (the builder has no file-write tool at all — only an atomic-write MCP call), plus a SessionStart hook that auto-injects your project context.

</p>

<details>
<summary><b>Cursor</b></summary>

Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "mindbase": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "mindbase-mcp"] } } }
```

Restart Cursor — the tool picker should list `mindbase_contribute` and 48 others. Recommended: add a conventions block to `~/.cursor/rules.md` so the LLM reliably routes "add to mindbase X" to the tools — copy it from the [guide](docs/guide.md#the-llm-in-cursorwindsurf-ignores-my-add-to-mindbase-request).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Windsurf</b></summary>

Cascade settings → MCP → add:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "mindbase": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "mindbase-mcp"] } } }
```

Same rules-file approach as Cursor works for Cascade.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Cline (VSCode)</b></summary>

Cline settings → **MCP Servers**:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "mindbase": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "mindbase-mcp"] } } }
```

Cline auto-detects; every tool call gets a confirmation dialog by default.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Continue.dev</b></summary>

`~/.continue/config.json`, under `experimental.modelContextProtocolServers`:

```json
{ "experimental": { "modelContextProtocolServers": [ { "transport": { "type": "stdio", "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "mindbase-mcp"] } } ] } }
```

MCP tools appear under `@` in chat.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Any other MCP client</b> (Zed, Aider, Goose, Claude Agent SDK…)</summary>

Point it at `npx -y mindbase-mcp` as a stdio server. See your client's MCP docs for the config location.

**Next:** create your first project and learn the four daily workflows in the **[Guide →](docs/guide.md)**

## The web UI

Since 0.3 the browser app stands on its own — write notes in a full WYSIWYG editor (`Cmd+N`), quick-capture from anywhere (`Cmd+I`), and run the AI operations with approval cards: `/contribute`, `/build`, `/lint`, `/research`. Live demos on the **[website](https://frankchu91.github.io/mindbase-llm-wiki/)**.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="MindBase web UI — category tree on the left, the LLM-maintained context.md in the center, chat starters on the right" src="docs/assets/webui.png" width="920">
</p>

**Free local models:** the setup wizard detects your hardware and installs what fits — `llama3.2:3b` (8GB), `qwen3:14b` (24GB+), or Meta's **Muse Glimmer 30B** (32GB+ Apple Silicon, Ollama ≥ 0.32.7). Measured guidance: qwen3:14b for interactive work (~30s), Glimmer for background lint/build — slower, but its findings quote the exact conflicting sentences. The model switcher on the chat composer flips between them in two clicks.

## Where your data lives

Everything is plain markdown under `~/mindbase-data/` (override: `MINDBASE_DATA_DIR`):

```
~/mindbase-data/projects/my-research/
├── README.md                 # Ops manual — you edit, LLM reads
├── context.md                # Synthesized truth — LLM writes, you approve
├── index.yaml                # Auto-generated catalog
├── sources/
│   ├── contributors/<you>/   # Your dated entries + notes (append-only)
│   ├── research/             # LLM-authored wiki pages
│   └── raw/                  # PDFs, HTML captures
├── logs/                     # Chronological operation log
├── artifacts/                # Briefs, exports, lint findings
└── state/builder/snapshots/  # context.md snapshots for rollback
```

No proprietary database — what you see on disk is what MindBase knows. `git init` it, back it up with anything, delete a project with `rm -rf`.
