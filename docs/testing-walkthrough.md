# Testing Walkthrough — Solo Dogfooding

A concrete, step-by-step walkthrough to verify every user-visible feature works
on **your** machine. 31 items, ~90 minutes if you do them all. Each item is
self-contained — skip around freely. Tick the boxes as you go.

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Server must be running (keep this in a terminal window)
pnpm -F @mindbase/server dev

# Open the web app
open http://localhost:4321
```

LLM proxy at `localhost:3456` must be running for AI features (Tier 3, 5, 7, 8).
Without it, you can still test Tiers 1, 2, 4, 6 (capture, RSS, settings, basic
UI).

Browser extension must be built: `pnpm -F @mindbase/browser-ext build`.

## What's intentionally NOT in this list

- **Android** — your machine has no JDK/Android SDK; the app exists as a code skeleton only
- **Daily Brief cron firing at 09:00** — covered by `pnpm test:e2e` (`brief-scheduler.test.ts`), not worth waiting for manually
- **Visual polish across dark/light mode** — eyeball it; no acceptance criterion
- **MCP server installed in Claude Desktop** — same flow as Claude Code, just edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

## When something doesn't work

For each failing item, share:
1. The item number (e.g. "**#14 URL capture**")
2. The exact step that failed and what you saw instead
3. **F12 console** screenshot if it's a web/popup problem
4. **`chrome://extensions` → Inspect service worker → Console** screenshot if it's extension polling
5. Server log tail: `tail -50 /tmp/mindbase-server.log`

I'll fix.

## Automated test suite (for context)

This walkthrough is the **manual** layer. The **automated** test suite covers
most of the backend / API / core logic:

```bash
pnpm test:all     # ~7s — core + server + MCP + extension (Playwright-headed)
pnpm test:web     # ~14s — web UI Playwright (Chromium required)
pnpm test:ios     # ~35s — iOS XCUITest (Xcode required, kept out of test:all)
```

If `test:all` passes, the backend / capture / RSS / SRS / Daily Brief building
logic is healthy. This manual walkthrough catches the things automation can't:
mobile share sheets, real SMTP delivery, LLM output quality, visual polish.
